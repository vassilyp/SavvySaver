# Inspiration

As students, we have found that there are very few high-quality resources on investing for those who are interested but don't have enough resources. Furthermore, we have found that investing and saving money can be a stressful experience. We hope to change this for those who want to save better with the help of our app, hopefully making it fun in the process!

# What it does

Our app first asks a new client a brief questionnaire about themselves. Then, using their banking history, it generates 3 "demons", aka bad spending habits, to kill. Then, after the client chooses a habit to work on, it brings them to a dashboard where they can monitor their weekly progress on a task. Once the week is over, the app declares whether the client successfully beat the mission - if they did, they get rewarded with points which they can exchange for RBC Loyalty points!

# How we built it

We built the frontend using React + Tailwind, using Routes to display our different pages. We used Cohere for our AI services, both for generating personalized weekly goals and creating a more in-depth report. We used Firebase for authentication + cloud database to keep track of users. For our data of users and transactions, as well as making/managing loyalty points, we used the RBC API.

# Challenges we ran into

Piecing the APIs together was probably our most difficult challenge. Besides learning the different APIs in general, integrating the different technologies got quite tricky when we are trying to do multiple things at the same time!

Besides API integration, definitely working without any sleep though was the hardest part!

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Definitely our biggest accomplishment was working so well together as a team. Despite only meeting each other the day before, we got along extremely well and were able to come up with some great ideas and execute under a lot of pressure (and sleep deprivation!) The biggest reward from this hackathon are the new friends we've found in each other :)

# What we learned

I think each of us learned very different things: this was ~~Homey and~~ Alex's first hackathon (edit: not Homey's first hackathon!), where they learned how to work under a small time constraint (and did extremely well!). Paige learned tons about React, frontend development, and working in a team. Vassily learned lots about his own strengths and weakness (surprisingly reliable at git, apparently, although he might have too much of a sweet tooth).
